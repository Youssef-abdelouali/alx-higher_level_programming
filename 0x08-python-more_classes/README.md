# Python - More Classes and Objects (Project 0x08)

**Overview:**
- **Author:** Youssef Abdelouali
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** Jan 29, 2024, 4:00 AM - Jan 30, 2024, 4:00 AM
- **Auto QA Review:** Scheduled at the deadline

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand Python programming and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Cover topics such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, special methods, class methods, static methods, and more.
- Develop skills in creating and manipulating instances of classes.

**Resources:**
- Recommended reading and watching materials on OOP in Python.

**Requirements:**
- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All code interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Follow coding style with pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- Ensure README.md file is present at the project's root.

**Tasks:**
1. **Simple Rectangle:**
   - Create an empty Rectangle class without importing any modules.
   - Instantiate the class and print its type and attributes.

2. **Real Definition of a Rectangle:**
   - Define a Rectangle class with private attributes width and height.
   - Implement properties and setters for width and height.
   - Allow instantiation with optional width and height.

3. **Area and Perimeter:**
   - Enhance Rectangle class with public methods for calculating area and perimeter.
   - Handle validations for width and height.

4. **String Representation:**
   - Implement methods to represent the rectangle as a string, using '#' characters.
   - Customize the representation for print(), str(), and repr().

5. **Eval is Magic:**
   - Extend Rectangle class to support recreation using eval().
   - Implement representation for eval().

6. **Detect Instance Deletion:**
   - Modify Rectangle class to print a message when an instance is deleted.
   - Demonstrate instance deletion in the provided main script.

7. **How Many Instances:**
   - Add a class attribute to count instances (number_of_instances).
   - Increment and decrement instance count during instantiation and deletion.

8. **Change Representation:**
   - Introduce a class attribute print_symbol to customize string representation.
   - Allow changing the print symbol dynamically.
   - Demonstrate symbol customization in the provided main script.

9. **Compare Rectangles:**
   - Implement a static method to compare two rectangles based on area.
   - Print a message indicating which rectangle is bigger or if they are equal.

10. **A Square is a Rectangle:**
    - Add a class method square() to create a new Rectangle instance with equal width and height.
    - Demonstrate square creation in the provided main script.

**Copyright and Plagiarism:**
- Strictly prohibit plagiarism, copying, or publishing project content.
- Violation may result in removal from the program.

**Note:**
- Ensure adherence to project requirements, coding style, and documentation.
- Execute provided main scripts to validate task implementations.
